# Weather App

[Live Project](https://laidev.github.io/WeatherApp/)

This is my weather app completed in correlation with the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app).


Input your ZipCode to display :

- Your Location Name
- The Current Date
- The Temperature of your current location

Future Implementations :

- Allow users to search using the name of their city
- Get weather forecast for next seven days
